# ML Image Transformations - MLIT
The ML Image Transformations (MLIT) app is a console utility app to transform images for machine learning tasks where you may need to generate multiple versions of an image to increase your dataset size. This app allows you to specify a folder of images and then specify the transformations to take place:
- Flip: Horizontal, Vertical
- Rotate: 90, 180, 270

In addition you can also specify the following:
- Resize
- Grayscale
- Crop

MLIT is written to take advantage of all the available processors on your machine, so the more cores you have the faster it will run.
